            <h2>Best Time to Visit Rajasthan</h2>
            <p>Rajasthan is a year-round destination, but the best time to visit is during the cooler months from October to March.</p>
            <p>Seasonal highlights include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Winter (October to March):</strong> Ideal for sightseeing and exploring the desert. Pleasant weather with cool mornings and evenings.</li>
                <li><strong>Summer (April to June):</strong> Hot temperatures, but a good time to experience local festivals. Suitable for budget travelers with off-season rates.</li>
                <li><strong>Monsoon (July to September):</strong> Scenic beauty with lush landscapes. Ideal for those who enjoy a quieter, less crowded experience.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Plan your trip according to your preferences for weather and activities.</p>
